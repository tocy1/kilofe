Question 1.
Steps Followed for Code implementation of Microservice 1
1. import necessary libraries
2. create GET/POST function to retrieve json from call
3. Send response to microservice 2 
4. Retrieve response from  microservice 2
5. Send response to User
Steps followed for Code Implementation of Microservice 2
1. Import necessary libraries
2. create GET/POST function to retrieve json from microservice 1
3. Send reverse of value of message key in json plus a random 2 decimal number in range of 1 to 100
Create Dockerfile for each  Microservices
build docker image with tag kilofe1 and kilofe2 for each microservice
Create manifest file for both containers in one pod
create service of type loadbalancer and expose pod on container1/server1 port
To Test
send Valid json  with a message key to http://loadbalacer-ip:8000/ GET/POST call
Check your response
Question 2 
To implement a CI/CD solution for these microservices.
Set up skaffold, Init skaffold and set u a project.
